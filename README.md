# Zahlensysteme
[en]
This is an open source project with german content. The main reason is for teaching IT stuff. Some students have problems in understanding how number systems work. 
So one part is done by description generated with LaTeX. The other parts are done in different programming languages.

For the beginning in 
- PHP
- JAVA
- C#

other programming languages are welcome :) as well as translations of the LaTeX files in other human languages. 

So in the LaTeX file, every source code is (and should be) added. 

The current PHP part is used in http://demo.hermann-bsd.de/zahlensysteme and still buggy :(
